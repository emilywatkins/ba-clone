# Bon App

#### Exercise in Angular, Typescript, and Firebase 4.6.18

#### Emily Watkins

## Description

This application is a clone of the Bon Appetit website (https://www.bonappetit.com/). The home page has a fairly simple style and uses an interesting template for displaying featured articles and recipes, which I hope to replicate in applying CRUD functionality to an admin of the site.

Nagivate to the below link to view and interact with the site.
https://ba-clone.firebaseapp.com/


## Functionality

Current:
A non-admin user can navigate to the site, click on a displayed recipe, and view that recipe.

An admin user is able to log in from the home page and have access to navigation unique from a non-admin user.

An admin user can add new recipes.

Future:
An admin user will be able to edit and delete recipes.

Upon creation, the recipes or articles will be formatted to render in the html with an image, title, and description.

Pipes will be incorporated in order to show featured articles, which will display on the home page, or to display similar articles on grouped pages such as most popular, healthy, regional, etc.
